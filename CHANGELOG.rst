Version 0.3.0
=============

Breaking changes
****************

- The variables exposed on the metrics endpoint were seriously refactored. The following metrics
  were removed:
    * pyaleph_processing_pending_messages_gtasks_total
    * pyaleph_processing_pending_messages_action_total
    * pyaleph_processing_pending_messages_messages_actions_total
    * pyaleph_processing_pending_messages_i_total
    * pyaleph_processing_pending_messages_j_total
- The `allow_amend` and `code.comment` fields are now mandatory for PROGRAM messages.

New features
************

- Users can now query the programs that respond to Aleph messages using the new /programs/on/messages endpoint.
- Users can now forget aggregates by specifying one or more aggregate keys in the `aggregates` field
  of the FORGET message.
- The message processing loop was heavily refactored. Users can now set parallel processing
  limits by message type to tune the CCN to their network abilities.
- A lot of improvements were made regarding code quality, by validating user data earlier in the process and using
  classes after the validation. This results in minor performance improvements and increases maintainability of
  the code base.
- We now use rotating log files. This resolves an issue where nodes could go out of disk space because of the size of
  the log files.
- Resolved a 500 error that occurred when feeding an invalid hash format to /storage/raw/{hash}.


Internal changes
****************

- A lot more tests!.
- The throughput of the TXs and message processing loops was improved. The jobs are now guaranteed to execute
  the same number of tasks over time, instead of a varying amount before.
- We now use unordered bulk inserts when writing to the DB. This potentially improves performance.

Version 0.2.1
=============

- Improved the code for the storage module and improved test coverage.
- Fixed a major synchronisation issue between CCNs. A shared variable was not updated correctly, making it impossible
  for CCNs to fetch the content linked to random messages.
- Fixed an issue where IPFS/P2P jobs in charge of listening to the "alive" topics would not restart
  once an error occurred.
- Fixed an issue resulting in a KeyError if an IPFS pin timed out.
- CCNs now required Python 3.8+ instead of Python 3.6.

Version 0.2.0
=============

- Replaced the P2P service by jsp2pd, an official libp2p daemon. This lifts the dependency on py-libp2p.
- The `--gen-key` option is renamed to `--gen-keys`. It now stores the public key along with the private key,
  and a serialized version of the private key for use by the P2P daemon.
- The private key for the P2P host can no longer be provided through the config.yml file using the `p2p.key`
  field. The key must be provided as a serialized file in the `keys` directory.
- Decommissioned the support for RocksDB. The only supported storage engine is now MongoDB.
- Decommissioned the dockerized VMs as they were replaced by the micro-VMs.
- The message API now supports filtering by content key, start date and end date.
- The "protocol" P2P config is disabled until further notice as it is not working properly.
- Fixed minor issues in the index page of the web service.

Version 0.1
