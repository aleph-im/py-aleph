# PyAleph Deployment

This directory contains the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file
to run an Aleph Node in production using the official Docker images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

See the [Docker-Compose documentation on readthedocs.io](https://pyaleph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/docker-compose.html)
for the documentation.

See [deployment/docker-build](../../docker-build) to build your own image of PyAleph and run it with Docker-Compose.
