# PyAleph: Python node for the Aleph network

Next generation network of decentralized big data applications. Development follows the [Aleph Whitepaper](https://github.com/moshemalawach/aleph-whitepaper).

## Documentation

Albeit still incomplete as it is a work in progress, documentation
can be found at http://pyaleph.readthedocs.io/ or 
built from this repository with `$ python setup.py docs`

## Deployment

We recommend following the 
[Easy deployment using Docker-Compose](https://pyaleph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/docker-compose.html)
section of the documentation to install a node.

## Development

[//]: # (TODO update)
Since PyAleph requires the installation of a few dependencies, the easiest way to start is the
[Docker and Docker Compose](https://github.com/aleph-im/pyaleph/tree/master/deployment/docker-build)
setup.

## Software used

PyAleph is written in Python and requires Python v3.6+. It will not work with older versions of Python.

PyAleph also relies on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/).

## License

PyAleph is open-source software, released under [The MIT License (MIT)](LICENSE.txt).
